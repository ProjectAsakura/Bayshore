## Credits
This software is part of [Project Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura).

It was first started by [Astelle Nightshade](https://github.com/ry00001), but most of the game's features were implemented by [Kitsu](https://github.com/shiroikitsu8).

Special thanks:
 - [Kitsu](https://github.com/shiroikitsu8) - code - like a *lot* of code, system administration help.
 - [Emi (PockyWitch)](https://twitter.com/ChocomintPuppy) - code, technical explanation, help with SSL, a lot more. You are the reason all of this is possible in the first place, Emi.

 - [The Wangan Midnight Emulation Discord server](https://discord.gg/r3nbd4x) - helping me out on a bunch of stuff.

## Donations
Donations are not required, however I'm only one person, and I'm still a student, so if you want to thank me for my work, [please buy me a coffee or two](https://ko-fi.com/lostkagamine).

This won't get you anything other than my gratitude, the entire project is and will always remain available to everyone for free.
